      <p>Hi! I’m teaching myself Full-Stack Development through The Odin Project and lots of hands-on exploration. This site is a working notebook: you’ll find bite-sized experiments, notes I wish I’d had earlier, and a living cheatsheet that grows as I learn. It’s primarily a reference for me, but if you’re learning too, take what helps and don’t be shy about suggesting improvements.</p>
