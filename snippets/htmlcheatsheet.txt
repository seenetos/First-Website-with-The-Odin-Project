#HTML Cheatsheet

HTML Boilerplate:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>


<strong></strong> = bold text, <em></em> = italic style text


Lists:
    Unordered List:
        <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>

    Ordered List:
        <ol>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>


Anchor and hypertext reference (link) example:
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>

        In this code: 
            target=”_blank”: opens the link in a new tab. rel=”noopener”: prevents the new tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security. Without noopener, the new tab could use JavaScript to interact with the original page, which is unsafe.

    noreferrer: 
        The noreferrer value of the rel attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from accessing the original page.


    Absolute and relative links:
        Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:

        Links to pages on other websites on the internet.
        Links to pages located on our own websites.

    
Example adding image:
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310"> (relative link in example)

        Alt attribute:
            Besides the src attribute, every image element should also have an alt (alternative text) attribute.
        Image size attributes:
            While not strictly required, specifying height and width attributes in image tags helps the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.
